## Apache-Struts-2.5-2.5.12---REST-Plugin-XStream-Remote-Code-Execution

`CVE-2017-9805` is yet another very legitimate vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework. Here I show you how easy it is to run a simple public `python script` against a vulnerable remote server, ultimately resulting in a reverse shell back to the attacker.

I have covered all the steps in this report with all the steps needed to create a vulnerable server and touch on a some basic indicators for detecting this type of activity in your own environment.

### Building a Vulnerable Server

I have used two virtual machines, one of them's running **Ubuntu 16.04.2** and that's gonna be my Apache struts machine otherwise the `target` and then the other one is running **Kali Linux** as my `attacker machine`.

First I installed `Tomcat 8` and `Java 1.8` to the `ubuntu machine` and only other thing needed to create a vulnerable server is to deploy the `vulnerable struts2-rest-showcase` application.

1. Install Tomcat 8:
**# sudo apt-get install tomcat8 tomcat8-admin**


2.  Now open the configuration file to add an admin user to Tomcat:
**# sudo nano /etc/tomcat8/tomcat-users.xml**
