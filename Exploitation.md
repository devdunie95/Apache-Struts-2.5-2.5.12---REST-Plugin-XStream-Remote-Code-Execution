##Apache-Struts-2.5-2.5.12---REST-Plugin-XStream-Remote-Code-Execution

`CVE-2017-9805` is yet another very legitimate vulnerability in the `Apache Struts framework`. Here I show you how easy it is to run a simple public `python script` against a vulnerable remote server, ultimately resulting in a reverse shell back to the attacker.

I have covered all the steps in this report with all the steps needed to create a vulnerable server and touch on a some basic indicators for detecting this type of activity in your own environment.
